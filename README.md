CrossST: An Efficient Pre-Training Framework for Cross-District Pattern Generalization in Urban Spatio-Temporal Forecasting

# Datasets
The dataset utilized in this experiment is derived from the open-source dataset [LargeST](https://github.com/liuxu77/LargeST). Notably, while LargeST offers data spanning a five-year period, we selected only data from a specific time frame for our analysis. The datasets involved in the experiment are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JLZOzN_QwNZO1xAlhy0O0HgfFgrd7zs4?usp=sharing). We extend our sincere gratitude to the authors of the referenced datasets.
